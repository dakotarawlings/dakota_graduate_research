# Dakota Rawlings Graduate Research

## Overview

This repository summarizes all of the projects, and associated code, that I developed during my graduate research in chemical engineering
1. [Molecular dynamics simulations](/molecular_modeling)
2. Spectroscopic charachterization and data analysis
3. Electrochemical transistor device measurements and data analysis

## Background

I recieved my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I worked for two world renowned Materials Science professors, Rachel Segalman and Michael Chabinyc. As a graduate researcher at UCSB, I developed an expertise in modeling and characterizing electrochemical materials. My research involved developing automated device control algorithms and data collection/processing programs using Python and MATLAB to evaluate the spectroscopic and electronic properties of novel electrochemical devices. Furthermore, I developed and implemented statistical mechanical models using Python and Fortran to predict material characteristics such as ion transport properties. My work resulted in 8 scientific publications, and I was the lead author on 3 of these publications.
