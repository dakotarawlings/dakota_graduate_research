# Statistical Mechanical Molecular Simulations

## Project Overview
* See [this document](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/gallery2019/DHanemannRawlings_report.pdf) for more information
* Wrote a moleclar dynamics simulation program to understand the effects of charge density, polymer chain stiffness, and polymer length on ion transport in ionic liquid functionalized conjugated polymers
* Wrote Fortran modules for completing computationally expesive steps (namely computing total energies and forces on each atom)
* This work inspired the work in my recent [first author publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c01811)
